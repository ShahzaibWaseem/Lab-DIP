# Lab 09: Spatial Filter (Basics)

## Tasks

### Task 1

#### Task 1a
**Effect of averaging and the size of averaging filters**
Apply averaging with a filter size of 3x3, 5x5, 15x15, and 35x35 on the image "[smoothing.tif](https://github.com/ShahzaibWaseem/Lab-DIP/blob/master/Lab%2009/Images/smoothing.tif)".

#### Task 1b
**Weighted Averaging Filter**
Apply different weighted averaging filters on the same image, "[smoothing.tif](https://github.com/ShahzaibWaseem/Lab-DIP/blob/master/Lab%2009/Images/smoothing.tif)"

### Task 2
**Gaussian Smoothing**
Apply the following Gaussian filter to the image "[smoothing.tif](https://github.com/ShahzaibWaseem/Lab-DIP/blob/master/Lab%2009/Images/smoothing.tif)". Ïƒ = 1.4.

### Task 3
**Un-sharp Masking**
Perform un-sharp masking on the image "[unsharpmasking.tif](https://github.com/ShahzaibWaseem/Lab-DIP/blob/master/Lab%2009/Images/unsharpmasking.tif)"

### Task 4
**Removal of Salt and Pepper noise**
"[saltandpaper.tif](https://github.com/ShahzaibWaseem/Lab-DIP/blob/master/Lab%2009/Images/saltandpaper.tif)" has salt and pepper noise. Which filtering approach do you consider will suit best to remove the said noise?
-> Median Smoothing

### Task 5
**Sharpening filters**
Do the Following Operations on the "[two_cats.jpg](https://github.com/ShahzaibWaseem/Lab-DIP/blob/master/Lab%2009/Images/two_cats.jpg)" image.
1. Use a spatial filter to get the horizontal edges of the image.
2. Use a spatial filter to get the vertical edges of the image.
3. Add the horizontal edge matrix to the vertical edge matrix to yield the following results.
