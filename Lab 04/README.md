# Lab 04: Connected Component Labeling

## Description
Connected components labeling scans an image and groups its pixels into components based on pixel connectivity, i.e. all pixels in a connected component share similar pixel intensity values and are in some way connected with each other. Once all groups have been determined, each pixel is labeled with a Gray-level or a color (color labeling) according to the component it was assigned to. 

Extracting and labeling of various disjoint and connected components in an image is central to many automated image analysis applications. 

## Lab Tasks
Implement the connected component labeling algorithm discussed in class on the image given in the lab.
